# The cumulative masses of a Poisson law in closed form

For a rate `r : ℝ≥0` the Poisson law `Po(r)` on `ℕ` assigns to the upper tail `{k | n < k}` the
value `P(n + 1, r)` of the regularized lower incomplete gamma function `TauCeti.regularizedGamma`,
and to the complementary lower half-line the value `1 - P(n + 1, r)`.

This is the Poisson entry of the closed-form cdf and tail target of
`TauCetiRoadmap/StandardDistributions/README.md`, Layer 2. It also supplies the native
cumulative-mass formula that the Poisson family entry of Layer 4 asks for, together with the cdf
of the cast law `Po(ℝ, r)` that the same entry derives from it.

The proof is an induction on `n` that needs no integral of its own. Stripping the atom at `n + 1`
off the tail above `n` decreases its mass by `exp (-r) * r ^ (n + 1) / (n + 1)!`, while
`TauCeti.regularizedGamma_add_one` decreases `P(n + 1, r)` by
`r ^ (n + 1) * exp (-r) / Γ(n + 2)`; the two decrements agree because
`Real.Gamma_nat_eq_factorial` identifies `Γ(n + 2)` with `(n + 1)!`. The induction starts at the
tail above `0`, whose mass `1 - exp (-r)` is `P(1, r)` by `TauCeti.regularizedGamma_one`.

Read the other way round, the resulting identity is the classical duality between a Poisson law of
rate `r` and a gamma law of integer shape: a Poisson variable of rate `r` exceeds `n` exactly as
often as the `(n + 1)`-st arrival of a unit-rate Poisson process occurs before time `r`, which is
the event `TauCeti.measureReal_Iic_gammaMeasure` measures.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.poissonMeasure_tail_eq_regularizedGamma` — the upper tail `Po(r) {k | n < k}` is
  `P(n + 1, r)`;
* `TauCeti.poissonMeasure_real_Iic` — the complementary cumulative mass `1 - P(n + 1, r)`;
* `TauCeti.sum_range_poissonMeasure_real_singleton` — the same identity written as the classical
  partial sum `∑ k ≤ n, exp (-r) * r ^ k / k !`;
* `TauCeti.cdf_map_cast_poissonMeasure` — the cumulative distribution function of the real-valued
  law `Po(ℝ, r)`, a step function with its jumps at the natural numbers;
* `TauCeti.measureReal_lt_of_hasLaw_poissonMeasure` and
  `TauCeti.measureReal_le_of_hasLaw_poissonMeasure` — the random-variable corollaries.
