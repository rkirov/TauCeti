# The conjugate transpose of a special unitary matrix is its adjugate

For a special unitary matrix the conjugate transpose is the inverse, and an invertible matrix of
determinant one is its own adjugate's inverse, so the two descriptions of the inverse agree. This
turns `star` on `Matrix.specialUnitaryGroup n α` into a polynomial expression in the entries, which
is what makes the small special unitary groups computable by hand.

## Main results

* `Matrix.specialUnitaryGroup.star_eq_adjugate`: the conjugate transpose of a special
  unitary matrix is its adjugate.
