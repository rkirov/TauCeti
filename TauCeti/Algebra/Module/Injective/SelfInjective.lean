# Self-injective algebras

A ring is **self-injective** when its regular left module is injective, `Module.Injective A A`.
This file proves the criterion producing the examples which come from a Frobenius structure: an
algebra over a field carrying an associative perfect bilinear form is self-injective.

The form is a `k`-bilinear `B : A →ₗ[k] A →ₗ[k] k` which is *associative*,
`B (x * y) z = B x (y * z)`, and *perfect* in the sense of `LinearMap.IsPerfPair`. Associativity
already forces `B x y = B 1 (x * y)`, so the form is multiplication followed by the linear
functional `B 1`, the Frobenius trace; perfectness is nondegeneracy in the strong form which also
makes every functional on `A` of the shape `B · a`.

Two general facts about Baer modules are proved along the way and stated in Mathlib's `Module.Baer`
namespace, which has neither. A retract of a Baer module is Baer (`Module.Baer.of_leftInverse`),
and consequently the left ideal cut out by an idempotent is Baer over a self-injective ring
(`Module.Baer.of_isIdempotentElem`): over a self-injective ring the principal projective modules
are injective. Everything is stated for `Module.Baer` rather than `Module.Injective` because the
two convert freely in one direction only, `Module.Baer.of_injective` costing a smallness hypothesis
on the ring.

## Main results

* `Function.Bijective.moduleBaer_self` and `Function.Bijective.moduleInjective_self`: an algebra
  over a field carrying an associative bilinear form whose flip is bijective is self-injective.
* `Module.Baer.of_leftInverse`: a retract of a Baer module is Baer.
* `Module.Baer.of_isIdempotentElem`: over a self-injective ring, a left ideal consisting of the
  elements fixed by right multiplication by an idempotent is Baer.

/-- **Over a self-injective ring the principal projective modules are injective**, in Baer's form:
if the regular module is Baer then so is a left ideal `p` consisting of the elements fixed by right
multiplication by an idempotent `e`, such a `p` being a retract of the regular module by right
multiplication by `e`. For `p = Ideal.span {e}` the hypothesis `hp` is
`TauCeti.mem_span_singleton_iff_mul_eq_self`. -/
