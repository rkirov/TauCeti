# A class function acts on an irreducible representation by a scalar

A continuous function `f` on a compact group `G` acts on a continuous representation `π` on `V`
by the **integrated operator**

`integratedOperator π hπ f = ∫ g, f g • π g ∂(haarProb G)`,

the Haar average of the action operators weighted by `f`. Its trace is the Haar integral of
`f · χ_π`, with no hypothesis on `f`.

When `f` is a **class function** — constant on conjugacy classes — the integrated operator commutes
with the action, because conjugating the integrand by `π h` translates its group variable by
`g ↦ h⁻¹ g h`, which normalized Haar measure does not see and which `f` does not see either. So for
an irreducible `π` over an algebraically closed field Schur's lemma makes it a scalar, and the trace
computation fixes that scalar:

`integratedOperator π hπ f = (dim V)⁻¹ · (∫ g, f g · χ_π g) • id`.

Specializing `f` to `conj χ_π` turns the character orthogonality relations into the character
projections; the irreducible block identities are in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/Character/Projection.lean`, and their assembly into the
isotypic projector is in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/Character/IsotypicProjection.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ContRepresentation.integratedOperator`: the operator `∫ g, f g • π g` by which a
  continuous scalar function acts on a continuous representation.
* `TauCeti.ContRepresentation.integratedOperatorₗ`: the same, linear in the acting function.
* `TauCeti.ContRepresentation.integratedIntertwiner`: the integrated operator of a class function,
  packaged as a continuous self-intertwiner.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ContRepresentation.trace_integratedOperator`: the trace of the integrated operator is
  `∫ g, f g · χ_π g`.
* `ContRepresentation.comp_integratedOperator`: integrated operators are natural with
  respect to continuous intertwiners.
* `TauCeti.ContRepresentation.integratedOperator_comp`: a class function acts by an intertwiner.
* `TauCeti.ContRepresentation.integratedOperator_eq_smul_id`: **a class function acts on a
  finite-dimensional irreducible representation by the scalar `(dim V)⁻¹ · ∫ g, f g · χ_π g`.**
* `TauCeti.ContRepresentation.integratedOperator_eq_zero`: it acts as zero when that integral
  vanishes.

## Implementation notes

Being a class function is carried as the bare hypothesis `∀ g h : G, f (h * g * h⁻¹) = f g`, the
same shape as in `TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/ClassFunctionLp.lean`, rather than as a new
predicate: it is passed directly through this API, and the `L²`-level notion that deserves a
bundling is the almost-everywhere one, `TauCeti.classFunctionLp`, which is already defined.

The definition asks only that `V` be a normed space: it is `TauCeti.haarAverage` of a continuous
family valued in the operator space `V →L[𝕜] V`, so it inherits that average's convention. What the
Bochner integral reads is completeness of that codomain, and `[CompleteSpace V]` is what supplies
it; failing that, the average is the integral's junk value `0` rather than the classical integrated
form `π(f)`. Completeness therefore enters with
`TauCeti.ContRepresentation.integratedOperator_apply`, finite-dimensionality with the trace, and
algebraic closedness of the scalars with Schur's lemma. The integrated operator
of the trivial group action and other structural identities are not developed here: what the
character projections need is linearity in `f`, the trace, and the scalar theorem.

The scalar in `integratedOperator_eq_smul_id` is `(dim V)⁻¹ · ∫ f · χ_π`, not `∫ f · conj χ_π`: the
integrand pairs `f` with the character itself, and the conjugation appears only when the acting
function is specialized to `conj χ_π`.
