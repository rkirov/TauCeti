# The degree of an isogeny

The degree of an isogeny `φ : W₁ → W₂` of affine Weierstrass curves over a field `F` is the
dimension of `W₁.FunctionField` over the image of the function-field pullback `φ.fieldPullback`
— the pulled-back copy of `W₂.FunctionField`, which that pullback embeds isomorphically. No
properness, smoothness or separability input is involved: the degree is field theory.

That reading is only honest once the extension is known to be finite, since `Module.finrank`
of an infinite extension reads `0`. Finiteness holds for every isogeny, and this file proves
it: the pullback of the affine coordinate is transcendental over `F`
(`TauCeti.Isogeny.transcendental_pullback_X`), so the pulled-back function field already
contains a transcendental element `t`, and `F(W₁)` is finite over `F(t)` because it is finite
over the rational function field. Positivity of the degree follows at once, and degree one reads
as an isomorphism on function fields.

Multiplicativity under composition is the `finrank` tower formula, applied to
`F(W₃) → F(W₂) → F(W₁)`. The pulled-back copies of `F(W₂)` and `F(W₃)` are subfields of
`F(W₁)`, so the tower is stated through `TauCeti.Isogeny.degree_eq_finrank`, which reads a
degree off any algebra structure whose structure map is the pullback.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Isogeny.degree`: the degree of an isogeny, with `TauCeti.Isogeny.degree_def` the
  equation lemma the module boundary makes necessary.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Isogeny.finiteDimensional`: **automatic finiteness** — the extension a degree
  measures is finite, the inseparable case included.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.degree_eq_finrank`: the degree read off an arbitrary algebra structure
  induced by the pullback.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.finiteDimensional_functionField`: the function-field extension is finite, for
  any algebra structure whose structure map is the pullback.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.degree_pos`: an isogeny has positive degree.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.degree_eq_one_iff`: degree one means the function-field pullback is onto;
  `TauCeti.Isogeny.degree_id` is the identity's case, and is the `@[simp]` normal form of a
  degree.
* `TauCeti.Isogeny.degree_comp`: **the tower formula** `deg (ψ ∘ φ) = deg ψ * deg φ`.

These are the `Isogeny.finiteDimensional` and `degree_pos` seeds of
`TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/Suggested.lean` together with the degree multiplicativity named
in `README.md` §Layer 1. The mathematics is Silverman, *The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves*,
II.2.4(a) and II.2.4(c) — where finiteness of the extension is exactly what makes a nonconstant
map of curves finite.

`degree` is the coordinate-ring form of D. Angdinata's function-field definition, as the
`Isogeny` structure itself is, and `finiteDimensional` is ⚠ mathlib-track material: it is proved
in that shared upstream development, in its function-field form, ahead of the mathlib PRs
(`TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md` §Provenance). It is built here until those land; the
proofs below are written against the coordinate-ring form rather than ported.

/-- **An isogeny has finite degree** (Silverman II.2.4(a)): the extension of `W₁.FunctionField`
over the pulled-back copy of `W₂.FunctionField` is finite, with no separability hypothesis —
purely inseparable isogenies such as Frobenius are covered.

The pulled-back copy contains the pullback `t` of the target's affine coordinate, transcendental
over `F` by `transcendental_pullback_X`, and `W₁.FunctionField` is finite over `F(t)`, because it
is a function field over `F`: finite over the rational function field, by
`WeierstrassCurve.Affine.finiteDimensional_functionField`. Enlarging the base field from `F(t)`
to the whole pulled-back copy keeps it finite. This is where the isogeny hypotheses are spent — a
merely arbitrary subfield of `W₁.FunctionField` need not sit under a finite extension. -/
