# The presentation-indexed limit behind the structure presheaf

Wedhorn §8.1 assigns `A⟨T/s⟩` to the rational subset `R(T/s)` and extends the assignment to an
arbitrary open `V ⊆ Spa(A,A⁺)` by the limit over the rational subsets contained in `V`. This file
constructs that limit **indexed by presentations rather than by rational subsets**, and makes it a
presheaf. It is deliberately not named for `𝒪_X`: see *What this is not, yet* below.

The index is `PresentationIndex`: a presentation together with a proof that the rational subset it
presents lies in `V`, ordered by refinement. `RefinementCategory` already makes the assignment
`p ↦ A⟨p.num / p.den⟩` functorial on presentations, so the diagram is obtained by restricting that
functor along the forgetful map, and the value is its limit — which exists because
`CompleteSeparatedTopCommRingCat` has all small limits.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.PresentationIndex` : the index category for an open — presentations
  whose numerator ideal is open, so that the basic open they present really is a rational subset.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.presentationIndexDiagram` : the diagram it indexes.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.presentationLimit` : the limit itself.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.presentationLimitMap` : the restriction morphism of a containment.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.presentationLimitPresheaf` : the presheaf they assemble into.

## Main results

* `IsDirected (TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.PresentationIndex Aplus V) (· ≤ ·)` : the index is
  directed — two admissible presentations refining `V` have an admissible common refinement.
  `Presentation.commonRefinement` leaves both index fields to its consumers, because
  `Presentation` carries no openness field.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.presentationLimit_hom_ext` : two morphisms into the limit agree as
  soon as their projections do.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.presentationLimitMap_comp_π` : restriction is reindexing —
  restricting and then projecting is projecting at the same presentation.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.presentationLimitMap_refl` and
  `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.presentationLimitMap_comp` : the two functor laws, as normal forms
  for a restriction map along `le_refl` and for a composite of two restriction maps.

## Why the index is presentations and not subsets

`A⟨T/s⟩` is built from the data `(T, s)`, and two presentations of the *same* rational subset give
canonically isomorphic but not equal rings. Indexing the limit by presentations rather than by
subsets avoids having to choose one.

## What this is not, yet

The presheaf built here is **not identified with Wedhorn's `𝒪_X`**, and is named for what it is
rather than for what it is expected to become. Wedhorn indexes by rational *subsets* `U ⊆ V`, which
presupposes that `𝒪_X(U)` is well defined; here the index is presentations, so the value depends a
priori on presentation data. Two results close the gap, and neither is yet available outright:

* refinement maps between two presentations of the *same* rational subset are isomorphisms, so that
  `p ↦ A⟨p.num / p.den⟩` descends to a function of the subset. The isomorphism is supplied by
  `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.presentationRingEquivOfEq`, but only for coordinate rings whose
  denominators are invertible in each other's coordinate ring and whose plus subrings are open —
  Wedhorn asks for neither, so the descent is not yet unconditional; and
* the presentation index is then cofinal in the subset index, so the two limits agree.

Until both are available unconditionally, no result here may be read as computing `𝒪_X(V)`, and
in particular nothing here shows the value on a rational open `U` is `A_U`. What *is* established
is self-contained: the limit exists, restriction along a containment is reindexing, and the two
functor laws hold.

## Provenance

The idea of indexing the limit by presentations, and the refinement relation ordering them, were
adapted from AINTLIB (Apache-2.0), commit `37bbdaeb9ad9e3bc9f0d660feadc2779e455a91c`,
`projects/AdicSpaces/Adic spaces/StructurePresheafLimit.lean`. The Lean here is written against this
repository's own `RefinementCategory` and `PairOfDefinition.Presentation` API; no code was copied.

The openness of `Ideal.span pres.num` is what makes `R(pres.num / pres.den)` a *rational* subset
in Wedhorn's sense rather than a general basic open — it is the defining condition of
`TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.spaRationalFamily`. Carrying it as a field of the index restricts the
diagram to admissible presentations; because it is a field, every object supplies its own proof
and the refinement morphisms carry no preservation obligation. -/

/-! ### The projection, and the restriction normal forms

`presentationLimit` is a `limit`, so Mathlib's `limit.w`, `limit.lift` and `limit.lift_π` are its
interface and are not restated here. Two names do have to exist. `presentationLimitπ` is
load-bearing rather than cosmetic: `presentationLimitMap`'s codomain is `presentationLimit W`, and
because that definition is sealed the elaborator will not identify it with `limit (diagram W)`, so
`limit.π` cannot be written at the use site — it reports *"definitions were not unfolded because
their definition is not exposed"*. `presentationLimit_hom_ext` follows it: `limit.hom_ext` leaves
goals spelled with `limit.π`, which the restriction lemmas below then fail to rewrite.
