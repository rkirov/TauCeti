# `U(n) = Circle · SU(n)`

The determinant of a complex unitary matrix has modulus one, and every point of the circle has a
`card n`-th root there, so a unitary matrix can be rescaled by a scalar of modulus one until its
determinant is one: the unitary group is the product of the scalars of modulus one with the special
unitary group. Rescaling by a scalar of modulus one keeps a matrix unitary, so nothing is lost.

## Main results

* `Matrix.exists_circle_smul_mem_specialUnitaryGroup`: every complex unitary matrix becomes
  special unitary after multiplication by a suitable scalar of modulus one.

/-- `U(n) = Circle · SU(n)`: every complex unitary matrix becomes special unitary after
multiplication by a suitable scalar of modulus one. The scalar is a `card n`-th root of the inverse
of the determinant, which has modulus one; the root is taken through `Circle.exp`. -/
